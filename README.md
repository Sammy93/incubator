# Project description
One of the most used instruments in a microbiology laboratory is the microbiological incubator, it is used for bacteria growth, incubation of cells and tempered storage. This project aims to create a incubator that can be fabricated in a typical makerspace environment at a low cost while achieving the same performance as commercial units. The incubator feature a parametric CAD design to allow the users to modify it depending on their volume requirements. Finally, the proposed incubator has two power options: mains-powered mode and battery powered mode for portable instrumentation in remote environments. 

# Hardware
The incubator is designed in Autodesk Fusion 360 which is free to use by hobbyist users, academics and small startups. The user is able to select parameters related to the incubator dimensions. The incubator has is designed  in such way that it allows fabrication by a laser cutter and easy assembly. Currently, the incubator is tested only using acrylic however significant performance improvement can be achieved if styrofoam is used instead.

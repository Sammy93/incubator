# Project description
One of the most used instruments in a microbiology laboratory is the microbiological incubator, it is used for bacteria growth, incubation of cells and tempered storage. This project aims to create a incubator that can be fabricated in a typical makerspace environment at a low cost while achieving the same performance as commercial units. The incubator feature a parametric CAD design to allow the users to modify it depending on their volume requirements. Finally, the proposed incubator has two power options: mains-powered mode and battery powered mode for portable instrumentation in remote environments. 

# Hardware
Hardware design goals 
Mechanical Design
The incubator is designed in Autodesk Fusion 360 which is free to use by hobbyist users, academics and small startups. The design is completely parametric and one can designed in a parametric open-source  CAD  software such as FreeCAD or  OpenSCAD. The user will be able to select parameters related to the incubator dimensions. Optional features would include add ons such as microscope slide holder or petri dish holder. An image of a very basic prototype designed by WaterScope in shown in  Figure 1. The incubator has to be designed  in such way that it allows fabrication by a laser cutter  and easy assembly. At the moment, acrylic is the prefered material however, if possible, other temperature resistant materials such as polycarbonate will be investigated.
